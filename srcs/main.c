/*
**	RULES
**	Your(s) program(s) should take the following arguments: 
**	â—¦ number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
**	â—¦ time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating time_to_die milliseconds since the beginning of their 
**									last meal or the beginning of the sim- ulation, they die.
**	â—¦ time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
**	â—¦ time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
**	â—¦ number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat times,
**																	the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.
**	â€¢ Each philosopher has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_philosophers.
**	â€¢ Philosopher number 1 sits next to philosopher number number_of_philosophers. 
**	â€¢ Any other philosopher number N sits between philosopher number N - 1 and philosopher number N + 1.
**
**	LOGS
**	About the logs of your program:
**	â€¢ Any state change of a philosopher must be formatted as follows:
**		â—¦ timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork â—¦ timestamp_in_ms X is eating
**		â—¦ timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
**		â—¦ timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
**		â—¦ timestamp_in_ms X died
**
**	Replace timestamp_in_ms with the current timestamp in milliseconds
**	and X with the philosopher number.
**	â€¢ A displayed state message should not be mixed up with another message.
**	â€¢ A message announcing a philosopher died should be displayed no more than 10 ms after the actual death of the philosopher.
**	â€¢ Again, philosophers should avoid dying!
